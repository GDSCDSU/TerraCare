## ‚ö†Ô∏è &nbsp;Problem Statement 

<blockquote style="font-size: 18px;">
"Recent summers see new record high temperatures each year, and I sense that spring and fall have become shorter."
<br> <br>
"The government doesn't prioritize environmental issues and lacks incentives for encouraging the purchase of environmentally friendly products."
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>These were the common responses to a survey titled <a href="https://www.af-info.or.jp/en/ed_clock/wdsense_result.html">"Survey on the Awareness of Environmental Issues Among the General Public"</a> conducted by The Asahi Glass Foundation in 2023.</p> 

2023 was the planet's warmest year on record, according to an analysis by scientists from NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). <br><br>Climate Change is causing a lot of environmental problems for our planet. While we are aware of it, we often lack the resources or motivation to come together and tackle these environmental issues. It's difficult for us to find local activities where we can collaborate to reduce the impact of these problems, and also we don't receive any sort of rewards or recognition for our efforts. Keeping track of our own impact and staying connected to a supportive community is also challenging and inconvenient. 
Moreover, finding one's way through eco-friendly products without incentives presents a challenge in making environmentally beneficial choices that are also financially viable for us.

## üéØ &nbsp;UN's Sustainable Development Goals in Focus


![SDG11](https://i.imgur.com/K07b4bk.png)

<p>
<strong>Target Indicator 11.6.2</strong>: TerraCare will help people to work together to improve air quality in their own cities. 
<br> <br>
Individuals who are passionate about the environment, our app allows them to team up with others to cleanup or plant trees where they're needed most. Users can post about an area for cleaning up/tree planting and specify if they need volunteers. Nearby users will receive a notification asking if they want to participate. 
<br> <br>
TerraCare tracks the collective impact of every user's clean up/tree planting efforts, showcasing the number of places cleaned/trees planted, the estimated carbon sequestered, and the improved air quality in those areas. This transparency will motivate individuals and communities to sustain their efforts and celebrate their achievements.
</p>

<br>

![SDG12](https://i.imgur.com/9rTlqWe.png)

<p>
<strong>Target Indicator 12.8.1</strong>: Our objective is to ensure universal awareness of sustainable living practices by 2030. 
<br> <br>
Through our app, we seek to educate individuals on sustainable habits like reducing waste and energy consumption, adopting responsible consumption practices, and making environmentally friendly product choices. We aspire to establish a community platform where users can connect with like-minded individuals, exchange eco-friendly tips and experiences, and participate in discussions about challenges and solutions related to sustainable living.
<br> <br>
Encouraging individuals to take action, change their behavior, and promoting lifelong learning and knowledge sharing are central objectives within our environmentally focused community.
</p>

<br>

![SDG13](https://i.imgur.com/ec332vz.png)

<p>
<strong>Target Indicator 13.2.2 & 13.3.1</strong>: We all know that climate change is a significant problem that requires collective action.
<br> <br>
With TerraCare, we aim to address this by providing a platform for users to track their environmental efforts, such as participating in cleanups and planting trees. We believe these activities are among the simplest yet most impactful ways for individuals to collectively mitigate the effects of climate change. 
<br> <br>
In addition to these features, our objective is to inform individuals about the science behind climate change, its wide-ranging impacts, and the possible solutions available.
